/**
 * Helper function for calling code that should fail after a timeout.
 * In short, it allows you to signal when the function succeeded, to cancel it, or
 * to be notified if it was canceled or completes.
 *
 * @example Verbose example
 * ```js
 * // This function is called by `waitFor` if it was cancelled
 * const onAborted = (reason:string) => {
 *  // 'reason' is a string describing why it has aborted.
 *  // ie: due to timeout or because done() was called with an error
 * };
 *
 * // This function is called by `waitFor` if it completed
 * const onComplete = (success:boolean) => {
 *  // Called if we were aborted or finished succesfully.
 *  // onComplete will be called after onAborted, if it was an error case
 * }
 *
 * // If done() is not called after 1000, onAborted will be called
 * // if done() is called or there was a timeout, onComplete is called
 * const done = waitFor(1000, onAborted, onComplete);
 *
 * // Signal completed successfully (thus calling onComplete(true))
 * done();
 *
 * // Signal there was an error (thus calling onAborted and onComplete(false))
 * done(`Some error`);
 * ```
 *
 * The completion handler is useful for removing event handlers.
 *
 * @example Compact example
 * ```js
 * const done = waitFor(1000,
 *  (reason) => {
 *    console.log(`Aborted: ${reason}`);
 *  },
 *  (success) => {
 *    console.log(`Completed. Success: ${success ?? `Yes!` : `No`}`)
 *  });
 *
 * try {
 *  runSomethingThatMightScrewUp();
 *  done(); // Signal it succeeded
 * } catch (e) {
 *  done(e); // Signal there was an error
 * }
 * ```
 * @param timeoutMs
 * @param onAborted
 * @param onComplete
 * @returns
