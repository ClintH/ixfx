/**
 * Queue (mutable). See also {@link IQueueImmutable} for the immutable version.
 *
 * Queues are useful if you want to treat 'older' or 'newer'
 * items differently. _Enqueing_ adds items at the back of the queue, while
 * _dequeing_ removes items from the front (ie. the oldest).
 *
 * ```js
 * const q = queue();       // Create
 * q.enqueue(`a`, `b`);     // Add two strings
 * const front = q.dequeue();  // `a` is at the front of queue (oldest)
 * ```
 *
 * @example Cap size to 5 items, throwing away newest items already in queue.
 * ```js
 * const q = queue({capacity: 5, discardPolicy: `newer`});
 * ```
 *
