/**
 * Helper function for calling code that should fail after a timeout.
 * In short, it allows you to signal when the function succeeded, to cancel it, or
 * to be notified if it was canceled or completes.
 *
 * It does not execute or track the outcome of execution itself. Rather it's a bit
 * of machinery that needs to be steered by your own logic.
 * 
 * `waitFor` takes a timeout, and two lifecycle functions, `onAborted` and `onComplete`.
 * `onAborted` is called if the timeout has elapsed. `onComplete` will run on either success or failure.
 * 
 * ```js
 * waitFor(1000, 
 * (error) => {
 *  // Failed
 * },
 * (success) => {
 *  if (success) {
 *    // Succeeded
 *  }
 * });
 * ```
 * 
 * When calling `waitFor` you get back a function to signal success or failure:
 * ```js
 * const done = waitFor(1000, onAborted, onComplete);
 * done();          // No parameters signals success
 * done('failed');  // A string parameter indicates failure
 * ```
 * 
 * @example Compact
 * ```js
 * const done = waitFor(1000,
 *  (reason) => {
 *    console.log(`Aborted: ${reason}`);
 *  });
 *
 * try {
 *  runSomethingThatMightScrewUp();
 *  done(); // Signal it succeeded
 * } catch (e) {
 *  done(e); // Signal there was an error
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * @example Verbose
 * ```js
 * // This function is called by `waitFor` if it was cancelled
 * const onAborted = (reason:string) => {
 *  // 'reason' is a string describing why it has aborted.
 *  // ie: due to timeout or because done() was called with an error
 * };
 *
 * // This function is called by `waitFor` if it completed
 * const onComplete = (success:boolean) => {
 *  // Called if we were aborted or finished succesfully.
 *  // onComplete will be called after onAborted, if it was an error case
 * }
 *
 * // If done() is not called after 1000, onAborted will be called
 * // if done() is called or there was a timeout, onComplete is called
 * const done = waitFor(1000, onAborted, onComplete);
 *
 * // Signal completed successfully (thus calling onComplete(true))
 * done();
 *
 * // Signal there was an error (thus calling onAborted and onComplete(false))
 * done(`Some error`);
 * ```
 *
 * The completion handler is useful for removing event handlers.
 *

 * @param timeoutMs
 * @param onAborted
 * @param onComplete
 * @returns
